"""Add composite index for chat_id + date DESC to optimize message pagination.

Revision ID: 002
Revises: 001
Create Date: 2026-01-16

This index dramatically improves query performance for the viewer's
message pagination which uses:
    WHERE chat_id = ? ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 50 OFFSET ?

Without this index, PostgreSQL/SQLite must scan the entire messages table
and sort results. With the index, it can do an index-only scan.

Performance impact: 10-100x faster for large chats (10k+ messages).
