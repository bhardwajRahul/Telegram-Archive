# Release Notes

## v2.2.9
### Features
- **Timezone-Aware Last Backup Time:** Last backup time is now displayed in the viewer sidebar and automatically converts to the browser's local timezone. Shows relative times (e.g., "Today at 14:30" or "Yesterday at 10:15") for better user experience.

---

## v2.2.7
### Features
- **Automated GitHub Releases:** New workflow automatically creates GitHub Releases for new tags.

### Fixes
- **Zero Storage Statistics:** Fixed an issue where media file sizes were reported as 0MB. Added self-correction logic to `telegram_backup.py` and a repair script `scripts/fix_media_sizes.py` for existing databases.

---

## v2.2.6
### Features
- **Configurable Database Timeout:** Added `DATABASE_TIMEOUT` environment variable (default: 30.0s). Increase this value to prevent "database is locked" errors on slow filesystems (e.g., Unraid/FUSE).

### Fixes
- Fixed `database is locked` issues on initial backup for systems with slow I/O by enabling configurable timeouts.
